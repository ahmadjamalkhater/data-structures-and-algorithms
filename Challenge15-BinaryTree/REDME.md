## Approach & Efficiency
In this project, I implemented a BinaryTree<<T>T> class, which represents a generic binary tree, and a BinarySearchTree<<T>T> class, which is a sub-class of BinaryTree<T> and represents a binary search tree.
The BinaryTree<T> class contains methods for depth-first traversals (pre-order, in-order, and post-order) to return arrays of values ordered appropriately.

Also, I added a method FindMaxValue to the BinaryTree<T> class to find the maximum value in the binary tree.

For the implementation of the FindMaxValue method, I used a recursive depth-first traversal approach starting from the root node. The method recursively explores the left and right subtrees to find the maximum value.


FindMaxValue: O(n) - The time complexity as it traverses all nodes once to find the maximum value.

## Solution

To use the binary tree and binary search tree classes, follow these steps:

- Include the BinaryTree<T> and BinarySearchTree<T> classes in your project.
-
Example
Here's an example of how to use the binary search tree to find the maximum value:



class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a binary search tree and add nodes
        BinarySearchTree<int> binarySearchTree = new BinarySearchTree<int>();
        binarySearchTree.Add(10);
        binarySearchTree.Add(5);
        binarySearchTree.Add(15);
        binarySearchTree.Add(3);
        binarySearchTree.Add(8);
        binarySearchTree.Add(20);

        int maxValue = binarySearchTree.FindMaxValue();
        Console.WriteLine("Maximum value in the binary tree: " + maxValue);
    }
}
Output:

Maximum value in the binary tree: 20

# Binary Tree Breadth-First Traversal

## Description
A method to implement a breadth-first traversal algorithm for a binary tree, and returns a list of all values encountered in the order they were encountered.
**breadth-first traversal visits all the nodes of the binary tree level by level, from left to right**

## Whiteboard Process
![](./Assest/cc17.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
To perform a breadth-first traversal, we use a queue data structure, The algorithm starts with the root node and enqueues it into the queue.
Then, "while" the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the front of the queue, add its value to the result list, and enqueue its left and right children (if present).

The time complexity of the breadth-first traversal algorithm is O(n) because we visit each node in the binary tree exactly once.
The space complexity is O(n), as it returns a list of all nodes

## Solution

Example:
```csharp

        BinaryTree<int> binaryTree = new BinaryTree<int>();
        binaryTree.Root = new Node<int>(2);
        binaryTree.Root.Left = new Node<int>(7);
        binaryTree.Root.Right = new Node<int>(5);
        binaryTree.Root.Left.Left = new Node<int>(2);
        binaryTree.Root.Left.Right = new Node<int>(6);
        binaryTree.Root.Right.Right = new Node<int>(9);
        binaryTree.Root.Left.Right.Left = new Node<int>(5);
        binaryTree.Root.Left.Right.Right = new Node<int>(11);
        binaryTree.Root.Right.Right.Left = new Node<int>(4);

        List<int> result = binaryTree.BreadthFirstTraversal(binaryTree.Root);
        Console.WriteLine("Breadth-First Traversal Result:");
        Console.WriteLine("[" + string.Join(",", result) + "]");

```

Output:
```
Breadth-First Traversal Result:
[2,7,5,2,6,9,5,11,4]
```
