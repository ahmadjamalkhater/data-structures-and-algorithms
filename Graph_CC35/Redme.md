## Summary

This C# project implements an undirected graph data structure, providing flexibility for modeling relationships between vertices. The README details the structure, usage, and testing of the implementation.

## Description

The project consists of a `Graph` class representing the undirected graph. Vertices and edges can be added, and information about the graph, such as vertices and neighbors, can be retrieved.

## Approach & Efficiency

The implementation is based on a dictionary to store vertices and their neighbors. Key methods ensure efficient addition of vertices, edges, and retrieval of information.

## Solution

An example usage of the graph is provided in the README, demonstrating how to create a graph, add vertices and edges, and retrieve information.
